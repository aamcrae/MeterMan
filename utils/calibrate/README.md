# MeterMan/calibrate
Calibrate allows visual fine-tuning of the LCD digits configuration.
The source is continually read and markers placed on the image to
show the digit mapping, and the images presented via a web server.
When the configuration file is changed, it is re-read to pick up
any changes in the LCD configuration.
